ercentages & Ratio–Proportion (with Formulas + Solutions)
📘 Formulas Recap

Percentage = (Value / Total) × 100

Change % = ((New – Old) / Old) × 100

If A is x% more than B → A = B × (1 + x/100)

If A is x% less than B → A = B × (1 – x/100)

Ratio a : b = a/b

If A : B = m : n → A/B = m/n

Compound ratio → multiply individual ratios

To convert ratio → percentage: (part/whole) × 100

Q1. 40% of 250 = ?
Formula: % of number = (percent × number) / 100
Solution: (40 × 250)/100 = 100
✅ Answer: 100

Q2. A’s salary is 20% more than B’s. If B = ₹5000, find A.
Formula: A = B × (1 + 20/100)
Solution: = 5000 × 1.2 = ₹6000
✅ Answer: ₹6000

Q3. In a class of 80 students, 60% are boys. How many girls?
Boys = 60% of 80 = (60×80)/100 = 48
Girls = 80 – 48 = 32
✅ Answer: 32 girls

Q4. If a number is increased by 25%, what is its new value?
Let original = 100 → new = 100 + 25 = 125
✅ Increase = ×1.25 of original

Q11. A:B = 4:5, B:C = 2:3 → find A:C
Make B same: multiply 1st by 2 → 8:10, 2nd by 5 → 10:15
→ A:B:C = 8:10:15 → A:C = 8:15
✅ Answer: 8:15

Q12. If 3x = 4y, find x : y.
x/y = 4/3
✅ Answer: 4:3

Question 6️⃣

Given:
A : B = 2 : 3
B : C = 4 : 5
Find A : B : C

Step 1️⃣: Write the two ratios
𝐴
:
𝐵
=
2
:
3
A:B=2:3
𝐵
:
𝐶
=
4
:
5
B:C=4:5

Here, we can see B is the common term, but its value is different in both ratios —
one has 3, and the other has 4.
We need to make the B values equal before combining.

Step 2️⃣: Make the ‘B’ term same

To make both Bs equal, find a common multiple of 3 and 4 → LCM = 12

Now adjust both ratios so that B = 12 in each.

𝐴
:
𝐵
=
2
:
3
⇒
Multiply each term by 4
→
8
:
12
A:B=2:3⇒Multiply each term by 4→8:12
𝐵
:
𝐶
=
4
:
5
⇒
Multiply each term by 3
→
12
:
15
B:C=4:5⇒Multiply each term by 3→12:15
Step 3️⃣: Combine them

Now that B is same (12), we can write:

𝐴
:
𝐵
:
𝐶
=
8
:
12
:
15
A:B:C=8:12:15

✅ Final Answer: A : B : C = 8 : 12 : 15
